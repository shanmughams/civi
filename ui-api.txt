Slide 2: What is the UI Layer?
Content:

Definition: The UI (User Interface) layer is the part of the application that interacts directly with the user.
Role:
Handles the presentation of data.
Manages user interactions.
Ensures a seamless user experience.
Technologies:
Angular
HTML
CSS
TypeScript
Image Suggestion: Screenshot of an Angular UI component or a simple diagram showing the user interacting with the UI layer.

Slide 3: Example of UI Layer in Angular
Content:

Angular Components:
The building blocks of the UI in Angular.
Consist of templates (HTML), styles (CSS), and business logic (TypeScript).
Explanation:
Angular components are used to build a modular and maintainable UI.
Each component handles a specific part of the user interface.
Benefits:
Component-based architecture allows for reusability.
Two-way data binding simplifies the synchronization between the model and the view.
Image Suggestion: Screenshot of the rendered Angular component in a web browser.

Slide 4: What is the API Layer?
Content:

Definition: The API (Application Programming Interface) layer serves as the intermediary between the UI and the backend services.
Role:
Manages communication between the UI and backend.
Handles data exchange.
Enforces business logic and data validation.
Technologies:
Java
Spring Boot
RESTful services
Image Suggestion: Diagram showing the API layer as a bridge between the UI and backend/database.

Slide 5: Interaction Between UI and API Layers
Content:

Data Flow:
User actions trigger events in the UI layer.
The UI layer sends requests to the API layer.
The API layer processes the requests and communicates with the backend.
The API layer sends responses back to the UI layer.
The UI layer updates the presentation based on the responses.
Diagram:
Show a flow diagram depicting the interaction between the UI and API layers.
Image Suggestion: A detailed flowchart showing the interaction between the Angular UI, the Spring Boot API, and the backend services.
